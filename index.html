Pursuing a Bachelors degree in Oceanography broadened my understanding of the intricate relationship between humans and the ocean, particularly within the realm of fisheries. When developing a career in quantitative fisheries I have had the opportunity to contribute to informed decision-making for sustainable development, while safeguarding marine resources.</a>

					<p>
					  In 2014 I graduated with a B.S in Marine Science from the University of Alicante, Spain. This programme equipped me with a robust understanding of the marine environment and also provided essential skills crucial for my professional growth such as applied statistics, or R-programming. It was back then, when I started to become more interested in applied science, and more particularly in the field of fisheries. 
					  <p>
					  My good academic performance opened doors to multiple scholarships enabling research periods at internatonal institutions such as the Puerto Morelos Coral System Unit affiliated to the National Autonomus University of Mexico, or the Dauphin Island Sea Lab in the United States. These experiences broadened my expertise in marine research, from extracting toxic proteins from Caribbean reefs anemones to modelling nutrient discharge from local rivers into the Golf of Mexico. 
						<p>
						Following a brief hiatus from academia, my interest in fisheries led me to pursue an MSc in Applied Fisheries Science by the University of Aberdeen, Scotland. This program not only delved deep into crucial aspects of fisheries mangagement, stock assessment or biology, but also promoted technical skills, and helped me to consolidate my programming skills in R, applied statistcs, spatial-temporal analysis or data visualization. Shortly after my graduation, I had the opportunity to assist the Scottish Pelagic Fisherman Association to an initial assessment on utilizing commercial pelagic data for fisheries management while promoting industry-science engagement. 
						<p>
						  In the following years, I have collaborated in different projects as a fisheries data analyst/modeller. In Chile, I worked with the National Fisheries Institute in developing multivariate models to define catch intention from Patagonian commerical fisheries data, while, during a short research period in the University of Vigo, I helped interpreting a vast inshore fisheries data set from in Galicia, Spain, to assess the role and importance of small-scale fisheries in local communities and the sustainalble development of this region.
						  
						  <p>
						   Presently based in Galway, Ireland, I work as a Shellfish Stock Assessment scientist at the Marine Institute. My work revolves around enhancing our comprehension of national fisheries to drive sustainable development in coastal communities.This involves collecting data at sea through commercial and scientific surveys, employing data-limited stock assessment models, or conducting spatial-temporal analyses of fisheries geo-positioning datasets to inform spatial management. Our analyses directly inform management authorities and stakeholders through detailed reports and advisory documents. I also actively take part in relevant ICES working groups and collaborate with international institutions and collegues. 
						   <p>
						  My career journey has shaped me into an skilled individual with extensive and diverse expertise in fisheries science. My  enthusiams is directed towards leveraging my quantitative data skills to provide robust science that aids in promoting well-informed  management decisions.
